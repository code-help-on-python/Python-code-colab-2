1. This is a list of the tallestbuildings. Tall buildings, such asskyscrapers, are intended here as enclosed structures with continuously occupiable floors and a height of at least 350 metres (1,150 ft). Such definition excludesnon-building structures, such astowers.
2. Historically, the world's tallest man-made structure was theGreat Pyramid of GizainEgypt, which held the position for over 3,800 years[3]until the construction ofLincoln Cathedralin 1311. TheStrasbourg CathedralinFrance, completed in 1439, was the world's tallest building until 1874.

4. The first building considered to be a skyscraper was the 138 ft (42.1 m)Home Insurance Building, built in Chicago in 1885. TheUnited Stateswould remain the location of the world's tallest building throughout the 20th century until 1998, when thePetronas Towerswere completed. Since then, two other buildings have gained the title:Taipei 101in 2004 andBurj Khalifain 2010.[4]Since the beginning of the 21st century, theMiddle East,China, andSoutheast Asiahave experienced booms in skyscraper construction.[5]
5. The international non-profit organizationCouncil on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat(CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of "The World's Tallest Building" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world.[6]The organization currently ranksBurj Khalifain Dubai as the tallest at 828 m (2,717 ft).[6]However, the CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not considered finished by the CTBUH.
6. In 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether thePetronas Towersor theSears Towerwas taller,[7]the council listed and ranked buildings in four categories:[8]
7. All categories measure the building from the level of the lowest significant open-air pedestrian entrance.[10]
8. Spiresare considered integral parts of the architectural design of buildings, changes to which would substantially change the appearance and design of the building, whereas antennas may be added or removed without such consequences. The Petronas Towers, with their spires, are thus ranked higher than the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) with its antennas, despite the Petronas Towers' lower roofs and lower highest point.[8]
9. Until 1996, the world's tallest building was defined by the height to the top of the tallest architectural element, including spires but not antennae.[8]In 1930, this definitional argument led to a rivalry between theBank of Manhattan Buildingand theChrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building (i.e. 40 Wall Street) employed only a short spire, was 282.5 m (927 ft) tall, and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large 38.1 m (125 ft) spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of 318.9 m (1,046 ft), although it had a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires were excluded.
10. Upset by Chrysler's victory,Shreve & Lamb, the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor, at 255 m (837 ft). They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly 30 m (98 ft) above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible.[11]

1. Filmsgenerate income from several revenue streams, includingtheatrical exhibition,home video,television broadcast rights, andmerchandising. However, theatricalbox-officeearnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both thenominal and real valueof their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.
2. Traditionally,war films,musicals, andhistorical dramashave been the most popular genres, butfranchise filmshave been among the best performers of the 21st century. There is strong interest in thesuperhero genre, with eleven films in theMarvel Cinematic Universefeaturing among the nominal top-earners. The most successful superhero film,Avengers: Endgame, is also the second-highest-grossing film on the nominal earnings chart, and there are four films in total based on theAvengerscomic books charting in the top twenty. OtherMarvel Comics adaptationshave also had success with theSpider-ManandX-Menproperties, while films based onBatmanandSupermanfromDC Comicshave generally performed well.Star Warsis also represented in the nominal earnings chart with five films, while theJurassic Parkfranchise features prominently. Although the nominal earnings chart is dominated by films adapted from pre-existing properties and sequels, it is headed byAvatar, which is an original work. Animated family films have performed consistently well, withDisney filmsenjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home-video era. Disney also enjoyed later success with films such asFrozenandits sequel,Zootopia, andThe Lion King(along withits computer-animated remake), as well as itsPixardivision, of whichInside Out 2,Incredibles 2, andToy Story 3and4have been the best performers. Beyond Disney and Pixar animation, China'sNe Zha 2(thehighest-grossing animated film), and theDespicable MeandShrekseries have met with the most success.
3. Whileinflationhas eroded the achievements of most films from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, there are franchises originating from that period that are still active. Besides theStar WarsandSupermanfranchises,James BondandGodzillafilms are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, thenGone with the Wind—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed inU.S. dollarsat their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.
4. With a worldwide box-office gross of over $2.9 billion,Avataris proclaimed to be the "highest-grossing" film, but such claims usually refer totheatricalrevenues only and do not take into accounthome videoandtelevisionincome, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings. Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful.Titanicearned $1.2 billion fromvideoandDVDsales and rentals,[1]in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theaters. While complete sales data are not available forAvatar, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD andBlu-rayunits in North America,[2]and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3]After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. Televisionbroadcastrights also substantially add to a film's earnings and, as of 2010, a film often earned the equivalent of as much as 20–25% of its theatrical box office for two television runs, on top ofpay-per-viewrevenues;[4]Titanicearned a further $55 million from theNBCandHBObroadcast rights,[1]equating to about 9% of its North American gross.
5. When a film is highly exploitable as a commercial property, its ancillary revenues can dwarf its income from direct film sales.[5]The Lion King(1994) earned over $2 billion in box-office and home video sales,[1]but this pales in comparison to the $8 billion earned at box offices around the world bythe stage adaptation.[6]Merchandisingcan be extremely lucrative too:The Lion Kingalso sold $3 billion of merchandise,[7]while Pixar'sCars—which earned $462 million in theatrical revenues and was only a modest hit by comparison to otherPixar films[8]—generated global merchandise sales of over $8 billion in the five years after its 2006 release.[9][10]Pixar had another huge hit withToy Story 3, which generated almost $10 billion in merchandise retail sales in addition to the $1 billion it earned at the box office.[11]
6. On this chart, films are ranked by the revenues from theatrical exhibition at their nominal value, along with the highest positions they attained. Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2 billion worldwide, withAvatarranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.
7. FBox Office Mojostopped updating its main total forFrozenin August 2014, while it was still in release. The total listed here incorporates subsequent earnings in Japan, Nigeria, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany up to the end of 2015 but omits earnings in Turkey, Iceland, Brazil, and Australia (2016), which amount to a few hundred thousand dollars. The total is rounded to $1 million to compensate for the numerical inaccuracy. It was re-released in the United Kingdom in December 2017 with the featuretteOlaf's Frozen Adventure, earning an additional $2.3 million.
8. F8In the case ofThe Fate of the Furiousthe gross is from an archived version of Box Office Mojo, after irregularities were discovered in the current figure. Ongoing weekly drops in the totals for several countries—Argentina being the worst affected—led to a drop in the overall worldwide total.[19]In view of what appears to be an aberration in the source, a previous figure is provided.
9. RKThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the Kingsaw its original gross corrected in early 2020. The result of this correction is thatSpider-Man: Far From Home,Captain MarvelandTransformers: Dark of the Moonall peaked one place lower than shown in the accompanying source.
10. TS3Box Office Mojo revised the grosses for Pixar films in August 2016, resulting in the gross forToy Story 3being corrected from $1.063 billion to $1.067 billion.[20][21]This means that it peaked at number 4 at the end of its run, ahead ofPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, rather than at number 5 as indicated by the source.
